        <h2>A Chinese Staple!</h2>
        <p>A famous Chinese dish consisting of beef and broccoli glazed with secret sauce./p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sherry</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 pound beef round steak, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed</li>
            <li>1 thin slice of fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 pound broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together oyster sauce, sherry, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl; stir until sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place steak in a shallow bowl. Pour oyster sauce mixture over meat, stir to coat, and marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger and garlic; let sizzle for about 1 minute to flavor oil, then remove and discard. Stir in broccoli. Toss and stir until bright green and almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove broccoli from the wok and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add a little more oil to the wok, if needed, then add beef with marinade. Stir and toss until sauce thickens and turns shiny and meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Return broccoli to the wok; stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
